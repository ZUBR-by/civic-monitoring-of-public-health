This Report was developed by the Belarusian Medical Solidarity Foundation, a non-governmental foundation aimed to help repressed Belarusian doctors. We started our work in response to the growing repressions and violence against medical workers in Belarus in October 2020. Our mission is to advance human rights for medics and citizens in Belarus by publicizing accurate information, organizing medics and supporters, and demonstrating solidarity.
